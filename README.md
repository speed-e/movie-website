# Movie Website Exercise

Spend the next 45-50 minutes trying to implement the desktop/mobile design as per the attached mock ups:

[Desktop mock up](/src/movie-desktop-react-exercise.png)
[Mobile mock up](/src/movie-mobile-react-exercise.png)

Retrieve the movies data from `movies.json` and render it responsively on desktop/mobile screens. For any screen that is wider than 600px, render 4 movie tiles in each row. If the screen width is smaller than 600px, display 2 movie tiles in a row.
